Mutual localization is a library to estimate 3D relative pose (position and
orientation) between two robots that can see each other by using 
fiducial markers.

The library also provides enough data and code to reproduce the experiments in
the paper. Please refer to the
[documentation](http://vikasdhiman.com/mutloc/doc/index.html) and the
[paper](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jryde/publications/iros2013_mutual_localization.pdf)
for more details.
